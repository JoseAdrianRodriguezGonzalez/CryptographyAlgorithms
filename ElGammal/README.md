# ELGammal

The ElGammal's algorithm is an algorithm that it bases on discret logarithm and large prime numbers to make the algoritm stronger.

## Definition

Let $F$ a finite field, thus $F^*$ has $N$ elements, being $N$ a large number. This number is prime or $N=pM$ such as $p$ has to be large number.
AS $F^*$ is cyclic, it exists an element $f \in F^*$ of $pM$ order.- Thus the element $g=f^M$ that has $p$ order. Let $G$ a subgroup of $F^*$ generated by $g$. This is:
$$G=\{g,g²,\dots, g^{p-2},g^{p-1},g^p=1\}$$

We choose an integer number $c$ randomly. $0 < c <p$ and $h= p^c$. Let $x$ a $G$ element. And $k$ a positive integer number randomly. We define the following functions

$$cipherElG^p_c : G \rightarrow G \times G cipherElG^p_c(x)=(g^k,xh^k)$$
$$decryptElG^p_c : G \rightarrow G \times G cipherElG^p_c(x_1,x_2)=x_2x_1^{-c}$$

The tuple $(g,h)$ is the public key, $c$ remains privately. The message without ciphering is $x$, the ciphered message is the tuple $(g^k,xh^k)$

## Demonstration of the decryption.
Let 

$$decryptElG^p_c(cipherElG^p_c(x))= x $$

To proof the decryption. Let's see what happens with a $x$ input

$$decrypElG^p_c(g^k,xh^k)= xh^kg^{-kc}=xg^{ck}g^{-kc}=x$$
