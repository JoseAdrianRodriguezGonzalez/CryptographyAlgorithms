# ElGamal

The ElGamal algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem based on the hardness of the
Discrete Logarithm Problem over finite cyclic groups.

## Definition

Let $F$ be a finite field. Then the multiplicative group $F^\times$ has
$N$ elements, where $N = pM$, with $p$ a large prime number.

Since $F^\times$ is cyclic, there exists an element $f \in F^\times$
of order $pM$. Define
$$g = f^M$$

Then $g$ has order $p$, and the subgroup generated by $g$ is

$$
G = \langle g \rangle = \left{ g^0 = 1, g^1, g^2, \dots, g^{p-1} \right}
$$

## Key Generation

Choose a secret integer $c$ such that

$$
1 \le c \le p-2
$$

and compute
$$h = g^c$$

- Public key: $(g, h)$
- Private key: $c$

---

## Encryption

Let $x \in G$ be the plaintext message.

Choose a random integer $k$ such that

$$
1 \le k \le p-2
$$

The encryption function is defined as:

$$
\text{Enc}_c(x) = (g^k, x h^k)
$$

---

## Decryption

Given a ciphertext $(x_1, x_2) \in G \times G$, the decryption function is:

$$
\text{Dec}_c(x_1, x_2) = x_2 \cdot x_1^{-c}
$$

---

## Proof of Correctness

We show that decryption recovers the original message:

$$
\text{Dec}_c(\text{Enc}_c(x)) = x
$$

Let

$$
\text{Enc}_c(x) = (g^k, x h^k)
$$

Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Dec}_c(g^k, x h^k)
&= x h^k \cdot (g^k)^{-c} \\
&= x g^{ck} \cdot g^{-ck} \\
&= x
\end{aligned}
$$

This proves the correctness of the ElGamal decryption algorithm.
